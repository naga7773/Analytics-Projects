Title: Data Explorationu using Python
Author: Naga Kamisetti

The aim of this project is to use python for data analysis using the Numpy and Pandas libraries
to explore titanic data set obtained from the kaggle website. 

The HTML file consists of both report and code, written in an interactive way using 
jupyter python notebook. In addition to the Numpy and Pandas libraries, I used Seaborn and matplotlib 
for creating visualizations. 
 
The csv files includes all the data used in creating this report. There are some missing values in the data.

The JPEG image shows the sample query using the API to get data from the oprnstreetmap database.

Skills Used: Python, Descriptive Statistics
