Title: Classification models using Census data in R


In this team project we built classification models to classify citizens based 
in to high and low income category based on census data. We built model using 
Logistic regression, CART, Random forest and Neural Nets approach.

The discretization file give the code used for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. 

The train and test data sets include the corresponding training and testing data used in the project.

The JPEG image shows the project approach from beginning to ending.
