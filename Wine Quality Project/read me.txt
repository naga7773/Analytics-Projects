The aim of this project is to explore different techniques available
in R for creating meaningful visualizations while understanding the procedure
of exploratory analysis of large data sets. In this project I used ggplot2 
library for creating layer by layer plots.

The RMD file contains all the R code.

The HTML file contains the report along with visualizations. 

The JPEG file is the correlation plot.
